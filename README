run code from main.py

for training, this uses train.csv and test_with_solutions.csv
test data must be in test.csv
results will be in rez.csv

code needs python 2.7, scikit-learn 0.12 (along with numpy, scipy, ..),
neurolab, nltk, maybe others :)

4gb of ram are needed
also, a fast cpu is recommended - ~30 minutes runtime on core i7
